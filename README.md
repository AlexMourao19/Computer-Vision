# M&M Detection in a Factory
## ðŸ“„ Project Description
This computer vision project aims to detect M&M candies on a production line in a factory setting. The objective is to automate the process of identifying and counting M&Ms to ensure quality control and optimize production efficiency. By using image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, the system can accurately detect the presence of M&Ms, differentiate them from the background, and potentially classify them by color or size.
